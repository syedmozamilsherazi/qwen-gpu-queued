The previous semantic segmentation approaches primarily address scale change without sufficiently tackling the other two specific challenges of fundus image segmentation. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper presents a novel approach, named the HFM-Seg network, aimed to enhance lesion segmentation using a hybrid foreground modeling network. It consists the relation-based and the optimization-based foreground modeling. The relation-based part of the HFM-Seg network uses the cene-context enhancement module to learn the foreground-background relationship to associate the foreground-related multi-scale context, so as to enhance the discrimination of foreground features. And the relation-based part of the HFM-Seg network adopts the adaptive foreground enhancement optimization, which pays attention to both foreground samples and background difficult samples in the training process, achieving balanced optimization. The mAUC values of HFM-Seg on the IDRiD, DDR, and E-optha datasets surpass the average of six other advanced methods by 7.76\\%, 15.09\\%, and 13.51\\% respectively, demonstrating HFM-Seg's effectiveness.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
