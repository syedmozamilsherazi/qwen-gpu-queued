However, due to these problems such as color, size, boundary blur, low contrast, and hair occlusion, it is more difficult to automatically segment skin diseases. In order to overcome these challenges, reduce the missed diagnosis rate and misdiagnosis rate, prevent patients from missing the best treatment period, and improve patient survival. We proposed a new lightweight network based on multi-scale Transformer, which extracts rich global context dependencies through the multi-scale Transformer of four parallel paths, and adds a simple boundary enhancement structure to the last layer of the network as local information , and finally segmented by a layer-by-layer decoding structure. A large number of experiments were carried out on four public data sets. Through the analysis of objective evaluation indicators, our method has improved compared with other excellent methods. From the comparison of visual effects, we can also see that our method is more accurate in boundary segmentation. Our method improved the segmentation accuracy and reduces the scale of the model, which is conducive to the rapid automatic segmentation of skin diseases, assists skin doctors in diagnosis, and improves efficiency and accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
