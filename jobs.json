As one of the most severe complications of diabetes, DR is the main cause of vision loss in the general working population and the elderly worldwide. Emerging evidence has revealed that DR is resulted from the dysregulation of the retinal neurovascular unit (NVU), indicating that microvascular abnormalities together with neurodegeneration or neuropathy both contribute to the development of retinopathy. Meanwhile, numerous investigations on non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) broaden our pathogenic understanding of DR. NcRNAs are a class of RNAs that generally do not encode the protein but participate in various important biological activities such as gene expression and translational regulation. Notably, a great number of studies have identified that ncRNAs get involved in the pathogenesis of DR through interaction with NVU, and this is achieved by elaborately regulating the pathophysiological signaling pathways and biochemical molecules within or between cells of NVU. Here, we discussed the relationship between ncRNAs and NVU in DR progression, which may provide novel therapeutic strategies for DR.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
