This condition leads to a dangerous eye disease called Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), which eventually causes total blindness. The purpose of this research is the early detection of this condition to prevent further complications in the future. Over the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) became very popular in resolving image processing and object detection problems for huge datasets. A cascaded model was proposed to detect the presence of DR and classify it into 4 stages, taking into consideration using a large dataset. Furthermore, preprocessing techniques such as normalization are applied, and finally, the input images are fed into a multi-layer Convolutional Neural Network. This method was utilized on 61,248 retinal images, which are a portion of the (EyePACS) dataset. It achieved a specificity of 96.1\\% for detecting the presence of the disease and 63.1\\% for determining its stage.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
