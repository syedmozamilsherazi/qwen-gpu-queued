Patients with diabetes experience a reduced quality of life, primarily due to complications such as diabetic retinopathy. This complication, affecting a substantial portion of individuals with diabetes, is one of the leading causes of vision loss in adults. However, vision loss can be prevented through early diagnosis. Problem: Developing computational models for diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of datasets with adequate annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to create. Solution: We introduce the Diabetic Retinopathy Annotation Tool, enabling automated annotation of retinal lesions in fundus images, expediting the process and allowing expert corrections. IS theory: This article incorporates ideas from Soft Systems Theory. Method: This research can be classified as explanatory, as it aims to establish a comprehensive theory by analyzing the results of experiments. This article employed a case study methodology to thoroughly examine fundus lesions, aiding in the creation of a tool for annotating and identifying these lesions. After, conducted experimental analysis to quantitatively evaluate the deep neural network model\u2019s ability to predict and automatically label retinal lesions. Results: The model achieved an mAP of 0.4390 on the validation dataset and 0.3002 on the test dataset from the DDR dataset. Additionally, the tool demonstrated promising results when applied to the IDRID dataset, compared to actual lesions. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: This work introduces a tool for the healthcare field, potentially aiding in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. The study also presents image processing techniques and computational model training methods applicable to future healthcare-oriented research.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
