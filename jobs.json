It progresses without subjective symptoms and leads to blindness in the worst case. However early detections and proper treatments can prevent visual disturbance. Because it takes time and cost for diagnoses by clinicians, research and development of diagnostic support systems has actively been conducted. This research aims to establish a fundus image classification method based on disease severity assessment for a diagnostic support by a fundus image analysis. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method to improve accuracy for severity classification. Our method has two features. The first is to extract Region-Of-Interest (ROI) sub-images focusing on regions locally capturing lesions in order to minimize background noise in image preprocessing for the classification. The second is to utilize the GNN which is not yet applied for fundus image classification. In order to evaluate our proposed method, we use Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD) utilized in \"Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation and Grading Challenge\" on Biomedical Imaging held at the IEEE International Symposium in 2018. We verified that the accuracy of our method improved 2.9\\% over the conventional method in this contest.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
