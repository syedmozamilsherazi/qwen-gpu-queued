In the current clinical practice, clinicians screen ubiquitous optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to visualize the retina's structural changes and diagnose the associated diseases. Quantitative assessment of such structural changes assumes significance in accurate disease management and treatment response monitoring. To this end, various attempts based on image processing, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been reported. However, they have not fully leveraged the unique structural characteristics of retinal sublayers in OCT B-Scans. In this work, we proposed a Pix2Pix-GAN-based algorithm capable of synthesizing look-alike target images from source images by mapping pixel-wise structural information. In particular, we envisioned the Pix2Pix network to synthesize OCT images with each boundary of interest labeled in the same color as the corresponding boundary in ground-truth images. On a dataset of 180 EDI OCT B-Scans with accurate ground-truth segmentation for six retinal sublayer boundaries, we trained and tested the Pix2Pix-GAN model. In particular, we achieved an overall mean Dice coefficient of 96.84 \\% and 96.85 \\%, respectively, for train and test dataset, indicating close agreement between ground-truth and proposed Pix2Pix-GAN-based segmentation.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
