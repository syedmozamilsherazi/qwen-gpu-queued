In hospital treatment or telemedicine, experts analyze and treat patients with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) based on the retinal images captured by the fundus camera. However, large number of non-pathological fundus images occupy too much time for the ophthalmologist to diagnose, and delay the timely treatment of patients with fundus DR. Therefore, it is a very urgent task to automatically and objectively screen whether the fundus has DR. Based on deep learning, we proposes an improved residual-dense module convolutional neural network structure (Modified Residual Dense Block Convolution Neural Network, MRDB-CNN). DR fundus images and non-DR fundus images are used for model training and the overall accuracy of the network structure is assessed by test set. Experiments have proved that the module can extract the detailed features of the fundus DR. The MRDB-CNN network structure can obtain a better generalization ability and a higher-precision network classification model while avoiding the complex image preprocessing. The accuracy of DR discrimination reached 94.90\\%, which reaches the needs of initial screening of fundus DR in hospital treatment and telemedicine.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
