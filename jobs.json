As symptoms of these diseases can usually be identified by inspecting cassava leafs, visual diagnosis of cassava leaf diseases is of significant importance in food security and agriculture development. Considering the shortage of qualified agricultural experts, automatic approaches for the image-based detection of cassava leaf diseases are in great demand. In this paper, on the basis of Vision Transformer, we propose a deep learning method to identify the type of viral disease in a cassava leaf image. The image dataset of cassava leaves is provided by the Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab in a Kaggle competition, consisting of 4 subtypes of diseases and healthy cassava leaves. Our results show that Vision-Transformer-based model can effectively achieve an excellent performance regarding the classification of cassava leaf diseases. After applying the K-Fold cross validation technique, our model reaches a categorization accuracy 0.9002 on the private test set. This score ranks top 3\\% in the leaderboard, and can get a silver medal prize in the Kaggle competition. Our method can be applied for the identification of diseased plants, and potentially prevent the irreparable damage of crops.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
