They are important indicators of early diabetic retinopathy. Detecting changes in the number of microaneurysms helps to judge the progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, microaneurysms occupy only a few pixels in fundus images. They have low contrast with the surrounding background, weak feature expression ability, and strong feature confusion. Detecting microaneurysms is an extremely difficult task. We propose a fundus microaneurysms detection method based on residual attention and dynamic weight. In order to achieve strong feature expression, we propose a residual attention fusion module to enhance the feature of the microaneurysms. In order to solve the problem of feature confusion between the microaneurysms and other strong interferences, we propose dynamic weight loss to constrain strong interferences at different scales. Implementation results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all metrics on the e-ophtha-MA dataset and IDRID dataset.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
