Since it affects the eyes, it can determine visual impairment or even blindness. Considering the number of diabetic patients worldwide, it is clear that effective screening of potential DR patients is of utmost importance. While direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy are the main methods for evaluating DR, artificial intelligence is on the rise in vision care. DR is detectable by analyzing data from patients\u2019 fundus photographs, and is therefore a disease that artificial intelligence tools can effectively support. In this paper, we present some preliminary numerical results obtained in discriminating between eye fundi of healthy individuals and of people with severe diabetic retinopathy, by using a Multiple Instance Learning approach.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
