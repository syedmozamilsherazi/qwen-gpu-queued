The prohibition of physical contact, avoidance of communal dining, installation of partitions, and restrictions on entry to exhibition venues have led to gradual changes in emotional interactions, culinary cultures, and modes of sharing and communication among people. Experts foresee a world that will continuously combat infectious diseases, and in the face of such a reality, innovative approaches are necessary to address the relationships between individuals and life, culture, and art, potentially fostering new modes of value.Technological art not only combines the latest technology with the expression of art forms, but the experience of new art forms is an issue that needs to be taken seriously in the future. We predict that the central ideas of new media art in the post-pandemic era will be mixed reality, floating projection and distance communication, combining multiple experiences into a single dining process.The \"EAT da Vinci 2.0\" project is an immersive experience of tea tasting that utilizes naked-eye mixed reality projection, unmanned aerial performances, and remote communication technologies to create immersive sensory experiences. By integrating art, technology, and local landscape, the project aims to rethink the new relationships between people and life, culture, and art in the post-pandemic era.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
