Sometimes, these features can also be the indicators for the examination of hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes. However, retinal blood vessels are often very small and complex in distribution, which brings toughness to the doctors when doing the operations of the segmentation of retinal blood vessels. Although the deep learning manners represented by U-Net has performed very well in the field of the segmentation of the images of the retinal blood vessel in recent years, the above-mentioned inconvenience still cannot be effectively settled. For the purpose of improving the correct rate of the segmentation and settling the above-mentioned inconvenience we propose a network called SF-U-Net, which uses accurate shape estimation and feature restoration to achieve the improvement of the accuracy. We follow the structure of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and Skip Connection of U-Net and use deformable convolution to accurately capture the shape of blood vessels when extracting features at the coding layer to overcome the problem of complex blood vessel distribution. At the decoding layer, we adopt a novel dual-stream up-sampling method to achieve accurate feature restoration. Experimental results show that our SF-U-Net is capable of improving the segmentation results of retinal blood vessels conspicuously. In the experiment, we use both fundus image datasets called DRIVE and CHASE-DB1 and the experimental results of multiple indicators on them surpass other deep-learning methods significantly. The experimental results of the SF-U-Net model on a variety of indicators on DRIVE dataset exceed the experimental performances of the currently most advanced methods. The mean accuracy is 0.9602 the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.9848 and the sensitivity is 0.8567.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
