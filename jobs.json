Diabetic retinopathy is one of such diseases that could benefit from early detection, but the amount of data available to train accurate models is limited. This challenge could be tackled through the use of synthetic data in the training of machine learning models. This paper proposes a novel procedure for the generation of synthetic data-sets for diabetic retinopathy that accurately reflect the characteristics and complexities of real-world medical data-sets. By employing a systematic literature review in combination with an expert study, this research aims to improve the data generation that underpins the performance and reliability of AI systems for diabetic retinopathy detection, enhancing early detection and treatment accessibility. Special attention is paid to inherent, human-centered issues in the synthetic data generation to mitigate representation risks.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
