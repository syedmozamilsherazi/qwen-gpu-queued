It is a proposal of classification of\u2002the diabetes retinopathy by early diagnosis based on the fusions of the clinic indicators and pathological images. For\u2002the feature extraction from retinal images, we implemented a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this model, we leverage clinical data as ancillary information for images to enhance the diagnostic\u2002ability of the model via fusing with image features. To be more specific, the neural network\u2002structure has been modified to handle the temporal information in the clinical data, and weighted and coupled with the image features obtained by CNN. To enhance its performance, we incorporated a self-attention mechanism to refine the feature fusion\u2002of images and clinical data and utilized a hybrid optimization strategy to train the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is effective in classifying DR and performing early diagnosis, with accuracy up to 92\\% and sensitivity for early diagnosis to 90\\% which is much more than the traditional method, indicating that the\u2002method has great clinical application value.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
