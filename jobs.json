The disease is characterized by the formation of drusen or the yellow deposits containing lipids forming within the macula region of the eye. One of the various ways to diagnose AMD is through obtaining fundus photography using a specialized retinal camera. This study assesses the accuracy of the proposed methodology in recognizing AMD-positive fundus images using Digital Image Processing and various Machine Learning models such as Na\\\"{\\i}ve Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The fundus images undergo intensity adjustment and bilateral filter it is then followed by optic disc extraction and Superpixel segmentation using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering. Features, such as Intensity-based statistics and Texton-map Histogram, are extracted and normalized. The resulting values are classified by various Machine Learning algorithms as positive or negative for AMD. The proposed methodology is able to determine Healthy and AMD-positive images while also providing accuracy comparison among Machine Learning models.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
