The World Health Organization recommended using facemasks as a preliminary measure that governments around the world could use help prevent the outbreak. The study's goal is to implement computer vision for facial detection with faces wearing a face mask. The study aims to: (1) capture facial features of masked faces using a Web Camera; and (2) detect a face with proper face mask orientation using deep neural network and mobile net model. (3) For the system to detect whether a person is appropriately wearing a face mask following IATF and WHO standards. The study only allowed one person to face the camera while wearing Standard Surgical Face Masks and being within eye level of the camera if ambient lighting was available. Face Mask Detection, with the Raspberry Pi, has checked the proper face mask orientation for 50 different individuals. The Confusion Matrix Testing determined the following values: 80 percent for the FMD's Accuracy, 62.5 percent for the FMD's Precision, 71.4 percent for the FMD's Recall, Sensitivity, and True Positive Rate, 66.6 percent for the F1 Score, and 16.6 percent for the False Positive Rate.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
