Recent deep learning-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in retinal vessel segmentation. However, they usually apply global image pre-processing and take the whole retinal images as input during network training, which have two drawbacks for accurate retinal vessel segmentation. First, these methods lack the utilization of the local patch information. Second, they overlook the geometric constraint that retina only occurs in a specific area within the whole image or the extracted patch. As a consequence, these global-based methods suffer in handling details, such as recognizing the small thin vessels, discriminating the optic disk, etc. To address these drawbacks, this study proposes a &lt;bold&gt;G&lt;/bold&gt;lobal and &lt;bold&gt;L&lt;/bold&gt;ocal enhanced residual &lt;bold&gt;U&lt;/bold&gt;-n&lt;bold&gt;E&lt;/bold&gt;t (&lt;italic&gt;GLUE&lt;/italic&gt;) for accurate retinal vessel segmentation, which benefits from both the globally and locally enhanced information inside the retinal region. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which consistently improves the segmentation accuracy over a conventional U-Net and achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
