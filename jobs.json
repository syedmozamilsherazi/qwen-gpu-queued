However, existing grading methods trained on high-quality fundus images often exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to low-quality images commonly encountered in clinical practice. To address this issue, we propose IELS-DR, a multi-task collaborative learning framework specifically designed for low-quality fundus images. The framework jointly optimizes three tasks: image enhancement, lesion segmentation, and lesion severity classification. It incorporates a dedicated image enhancement subnet tailored for low-quality images to improve clarity and facilitate downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-task Feature Aggregation (CFA) module, which employs a cross-task, multi-scale CNN architecture to enable deep feature sharing and interaction between lesion segmentation and DR classification tasks. The CFA module enhances multi-scale feature fusion, strengthens lesion feature representation, and promotes effective task collaboration. Experiments on the DDR dataset show that IELS-DR delivers leading performance, with an accuracy of 86.61\\%, precision of 83.57\\%, kappa of 82.36\\%, recall of 85.09\\%, and F1-score of 84.25\\%. Furthermore, it delivers competitive results in image enhancement and lesion segmentation tasks. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework and CFA module in improving robustness for low-quality image analysis and DR grading.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
