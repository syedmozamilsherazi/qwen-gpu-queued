Numerous self-supervised learning methods have been proposed, and several medical artificial intelligence studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this technique in enhancing model performance. Nonetheless, only a few studies have investigated which self-supervised learning methods are appropriate for medical images. In this study, a comparative analysis to determine the most suitable self-supervised learning methods for developing medical artificial intelligence models using optical coherence tomography images. Four self-supervised learning methods were tested, and models were developed and validated using two publicly available optical coherence tomography datasets. The reliability of the model output was assessed through Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping analysis. As a result, using contrastive learning-based self-supervised learning methods, better performance was observed compared to other models, resulting in 99.90\\% and 99.05\\% accuracy for the two public optical coherence tomography datasets, which represents a 0.8\\% and 2.86\\% improvement over conventional supervised learning training. In addition, we confirmed that the contrastive learning-based model can more reliably localize disease lesions in the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping analysis.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
