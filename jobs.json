The introduction of artificial intelligence as a supplementary diagnostic method can effectively reduce the cost of screening for fundus diseases. The scarcity of abnormal fundus photos and the black-box nature of deep learning have hindered the implementation and application of AI-assisted diagnosis. In this study, we propose a deep mining method for fundus disease information based on a heat map. The method incorporates the gradient calculation idea of CAM and the detection process of FastFlow. Only normal fundus photo images are learned during training and are no longer limited to abnormal fundus photos. By extracting features from the input fundus photo images, calculating the gradient matrix and probability map, and outputting the heat map and predicted mask, the model can achieve segmentation of abnormal regions and present the important features in the fundus photo images to the doctor, enabling the doctor not only to obtain the prediction results of the model, but also to judge whether the results given by the model are reliable based on the inference basis of the model, and to give the final treatment decision after referring to the model The final treatment decision is made after referring to the model's diagnostic results.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
