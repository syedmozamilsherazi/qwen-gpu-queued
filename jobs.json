The multi-scale fusion structure is the key approach to improving the classification of diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, we made enhancements to the existing ResNest backbone by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within each single radix block. This effectively boosted the multi-scale representation ability of the backbone, and the novel backbone exhibits superior performance without imposing an excessive computational burden on the model. The validation results based on the Kaggle competition data show that, the model can classify the DR severity more accurately than the traditional model.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
