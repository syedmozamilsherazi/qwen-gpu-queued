As the optic papilla shows morphological variations in the population, its identification can be a challenge. Methods based on deep learning have shown promise in helping doctors analyse these images more accurately. Recently, models such as Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown significant results in various medical applications, including glaucoma detection. However, the scarcity of quality data remains a major obstacle to training these models. This study evaluated the performance of the Swin Transformer, DeiT and Linformer models in detecting optic papilla excavation, using the new Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET). The results showed that the DeiT model obtained the best accuracy, with 0.94, followed by the Swin Transformer, with 0.88, and the Linformer, with 0.85. The findings of this study suggest that ViT models can not only significantly improve the detection of glaucomatous papillary excavation, but also strengthen Human-Machine Collaboration, promoting more effective interaction between doctors and automated systems in medical diagnosis.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
