In recent years, the field of dysgraphia research has developed diverse research centers and cutting-edge branches.Objective: To investigate the hotspots and future trends of dysgraphia research, and to provide theoretical references for scholars to analyze the current status of dysgraphia research and to develop new research frontiers.METHODS: Bibliometric methods were used to screen the literature related to dysgraphia from 2003 to 2023 included in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and with the help of the visualization software CiteSpace and VOSviewer, we drew and interpreted the corresponding visual maps. interpretation.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: from 2003 to 2023, there is a general upward trend in annual publications on dysgraphia; the top three countries with the most publications are the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom; journal co-citation analysis reveals three major journal clusters: neurology, cognition, and human movement; and authors' co-presentation analysis reveals that Faundez-zanuy Marcos is the most prolific author and showed a significant collaboration with Anzalone Salvatore M on robotic interaction therapy for children with dysgraphia; keyword analysis showed that \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cperformance\u201d, \u201cdysgraphia \u201c, and \u201chandwriting\u201d are keywords that appear with high frequency in the literature. There has been a steady increase in the publication of research on dysgraphia over the past two decades, with a focus on dissecting neural, cognitive, and motor mechanisms. The current focus has shifted to exploring the etiology of childhood dysgraphia, moving away from pure symptomatology to consider underlying causes and delve deeper into root causes. In the future, the study of dysgraphia as a symptom of disease will receive more attention, and there will be a new trend towards exploring the origins of the disease.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
