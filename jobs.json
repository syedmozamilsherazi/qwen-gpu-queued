Usually, the detection becomes possible in a stage where disease symptoms are already visible on the aerial part of the plant. However, once the disease has manifested in different parts of the plant, little can be done to salvage the situation. Here, we suggest that the use of visible and near infrared spectral information facilitates disease detection in cassava crops before symptoms can be seen by the human eye. To test this hypothesis, we grow cassava plants in a screen house where they are inoculated with disease viruses. We monitor the plants over time collecting both spectra and plant tissue for wet chemistry analysis. Our results demonstrate that suitably trained classifiers are indeed able to detect cassava diseases. Specifically, we consider Generalized Matrix Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) applied to original spectra and, alternatively, in combination with dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We show that successful detection is possible shortly after the infection can be confirmed by wet lab chemistry, several weeks before symptoms manifest on the plants.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
