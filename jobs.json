The accurate classification of fundus images depicting various ocular diseases plays a vital role in early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. However, medical datasets for such conditions often suffer from limited samples and imbalanced class distributions, making classification tasks more challenging. In this study, we address the multi-classification of fundus images of ocular diseases, considering the aforementioned dataset limitations. We specifically focus on three distinct ocular diseases, along with normal fundus images. In medical data analysis, the availability of labeled data is often limited, and the distribution of classes is frequently imbalanced. To address these challenges, we propose the utilization of triple generative adversarial nets (TripleGAN), a semi-supervised generative network, for medical data classification tasks. Through rigorous experimentation and training, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness triple generative adversarial nets. After 500 iterations, our model achieves a stable test accuracy of approximately 70\\%. Furthermore, our approach exhibits resilience to loss variation, ensuring consistent performance across different stages of training. The results of our study indicate promising potential in the accurate classification of fundus images of ocular diseases, even in the presence of under-sampled and unbalanced datasets. Our findings contribute to the research in the field of ophthalmic image analysis and may aid in the development of advanced diagnostic tools for ocular diseases.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
