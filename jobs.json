Ophthalmology is an area of medicine that deals with the eye and vision. In many remote areas, people do not have access to ophthalmologists, and many go blind for preventable reasons. Awareness about eye health and early diagnosis is essential in eye health to prevent blindness. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can quickly detect eye disease is valuable and necessary. Anterior segment eye images are essential and easily obtained without additional equipment. In this study, I aimed to build an artificial intelligence algorithm to detect eye diseases from mobile photographs. I extracted and combined anterior segment eye photos from various publicly available datasets and labeled 3938 images as Normal (healthy) and 1094 images as Abnormal (unhealthy). I increased the data diversity by augmenting it with random flips and rotations: and then prepared it for AI training. I re-trained the algorithms trained in ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge with the transfer learning method. I compared custom and pre-trained models. After evaluating the performance of the models with the test set, 98\\% accuracy and 97\\% F1 score were obtained with the Inception-ResNetV2 model.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
