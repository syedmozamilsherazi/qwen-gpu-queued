However, the task remains challenging due to low contrast between vessels and background, complex morphological structures, and the scarcity of annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose HCM, a novel Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for semi-supervised retinal vessel segmentation. HCM integrates the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Mamba architecture, leveraging CNN's local feature extraction capabilities and Mamba's global dependency modeling.  Furthermore, we propose Multi-Scale Contrastive Learning (MSCL), which combines image-level, region-level, and pixel-level contrastive losses to optimize feature learning across different scales. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, and STARE datasets demonstrate that HCM outperforms existing semi-supervised methods, achieving superior performance in terms of Dice coefficient, sensitivity, and intersection-over-union (IoU). Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture and the MSCL, highlighting their contributions to robust and accurate retinal vessel segmentation. Our work provides a promising solution for leveraging limited annotated data and improving segmentation performance in retinal vessel segmentation.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
