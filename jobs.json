Given a multi-modal case consisting of a color fundus photo (CFP) and an array of OCT B-scan images acquired during an eye examination, we aim to build a deep neural network that recognizes multiple vision-threatening diseases for the given case. As the diagnostic efficacy of CFP and OCT is disease-dependent, the network's ability of being both selective and interpretable is important. Moreover, as both data acquisition and manual labeling are extremely expensive in the medical domain, the network has to be relatively lightweight for learning from a limited set of labeled multi-modal samples. Prior art on retinal disease recognition focuses either on a single disease or on a single modality, leaving multi-modal fusion largely underexplored. We propose in this paper Multi-Modal Multi-Instance Learning (MM-MIL) for selectively fusing CFP and OCT modalities. Its lightweight architecture (as compared to current multi-head attention modules) makes it suited for learning from relatively small-sized datasets. For an effective use of MM-MIL, we propose to generate a pseudo sequence of CFPs by over sampling a given CFP. The benefits of this tactic include well balancing instances across modalities, increasing the resolution of the CFP input, and finding out regions of the CFP most relevant with respect to the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 1,206 multi-modal cases from 1,193 eyes of 836 subjects demonstrate the viability of the proposed model.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
