Ophthalmology, encompassing disease screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, heavily reliant on images from eye examinations, generates vast amounts of image data and has been a pioneer in medical AI, with numerous high-quality open-source datasets. However, the clinical demands placed on physicians necessitate swift patient diagnoses, resulting in insufficient time for meticulous annotations. Consequently, there exists a considerable amount of unannotated data that hinders further AI development in ophthalmology. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) have gained significant attention for their ability to extract meaningful features from unlabeled data, decreasing the need for clinical expert labeling and enabling effective transfer to downstream tasks. Therefore, increasing efforts is being made to explore the SSL paradigm in ophthalmic AI research. This review aims to provide ophthalmic researchers with a panoramic view of the SSL paradigm, outlining its basic concepts, processes, and mainstream frameworks. We comprehensively review the ophthalmic applications based on SSL in computer vision (CV) over the past five years and discuss the current limitations and future directions of SSL in ophthalmology.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
