The microvascular leakage will decrease or loss of sight. The aim of this research is to find the retinal blood vessel detection method for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. This study was carried out using the principle of image processing to analyze the retina image. The green channel was used for data processing. Consequently, several image processing techniques were applied to the green channel data as image enhancement, scaling, morphological operator and filter to extract the features of the retinal blood vessel in the retina image. The retinal blood vessel was extracted and displayed on the screen for diagnosis. The efficiency of algorithm for the retinal blood vessel detection was presented in this study. All different twenty retinal images from the DRIVE database were tested for blood vessel extraction. The error detection data was compared with the ground truth image. The results show that the maximum specificity and accuracy were 99.66\\% and 96.80\\%, respectively. It indicated that the proposed method could detect the blood vessel from retina image.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
