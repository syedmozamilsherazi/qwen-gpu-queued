Hospitals and staff face an ever-increasing workload, and therefore the demand for autonomous supportive diagnosis systems is more and more important. We propose a deep neural network for online eye disease detection that runs in real-time (Faster than 30 fps) on a Raspberry Pi 5 microcontroller, achieving similar results compared to the not-resource-optimized version of the model. This can help in developing testing stations for patients that do not require personal guidance. It is also possible to integrate it into modern smart glasses, which are able to scan the inside of the eyeball with a low-power laser.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
