It can extract information such as the area of interest, human tissue, and lesion size. Diseases of the nervous system, leukemia, and diabetes can cause eye problems. To observe the changes in the distribution, structure, and morphological characteristics of blood vessels in retinal images by image segmentation, and it also can help diagnose the degree of lesions of the above diseases to a certain extent. Although the commonly used artificial segmentation is the gold standard, it has the disadvantages of being time-consuming, power-consuming, and unable to reproduce, so the research on accurate and efficient automatic image segmentation method is the focus of image segmentation research. Because of the problems, such as partial feature data loss, low segmentation accuracy, and pathological information segmentation errors that may occur in the traditional U-Net model during retinal image segmentation, we proposed an improved U-Net based retinal image segmentation model \u2013 SU-Net. In this method, an attention module is added to the U-Net coding process, which can fully capture the context information to improve the accuracy of image feature extraction. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by testing on the publicly available retina data set. The average IoU, Dice coefficient, and global segmentation accuracy were taken as evaluation indexes. Compared with the U-Net model, experiments show that the accuracy of IoU, Dice, and global segmentation has increased by 0.7, 0.9, and 0.2, and reached 82.4\\%, 82.2\\%, and 95.5\\% respectively.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
