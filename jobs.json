Among the common retinal fundus diseases, glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration stand out for their ability to inflict retinal damage, resulting in vision impairment and even blindness. Therefore, early detection of these diseases holds immense importance for subsequent treatment interventions. While numerous studies have explored the classification of fundus image diseases based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the majority have primarily focused on the two types of ophthalmic diseases in the top two prevalences, namely age-related macular degeneration (196 million patients worldwide) and diabetic retinopathy (146 million patients worldwide), with limited attention given to other fundus disease classifications. To address the aforementioned gaps, this research paper aims to employ deep learning technology in conjunction with computer vision techniques to classify and diagnose fundus diseases. The specific research objectives are as follows: (1) Investigation of classical convolutional network models, such as VGGNet19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and Swin-Transformer, training them in three stages. Stage 1 uses network model framework training, stage 2 entails transfer learning training, and stage 3 encompasses training after data enhancement of the dataset. Each stage involves the selection of models exhibiting exceptional performance, ultimately leading to the identification of the optimal model. (2) Leveraging the foundation of convolutional neural networks, a transfer learning-based classification method is proposed for fundus images using a small dataset. This involves utilizing the pre-trained deep learning model screened out in Phase 1, reconfiguring its fully connected layer, and adapting it to the four-classification task of fundus disease. (3) The experimental data is sourced from the Eye Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) database, and the data on the test set should be validated using cross-validation. Additionally, data augmentation is implemented using six techniques facilitated by the OpenCV library. The experimental results show that DenseNet121, based on convolutional neural networks, exhibits superior performance in distinguishing between the four types of fundus diseases, and achieving the optimal classification accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
