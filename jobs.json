In the exploration of multi-visual sensory stimulation to reduce cognitive processes and memory enabling the improvement of cognitive abilities in older. Develop mobile health care applications to improve memory cognitive decline in the elderly Monitor positioning and set up interactive games to enhance the thinking and cognition of the elderly. Through online questionnaires and multifaceted research on research subjects such as the elderly and non-professional caregivers, organize and summarize the survey paper, and sort out and analyze the data to support the app design. The aim is the inclusive design of a cognitive training digital UI design for Alzheimer's disease patients and evaluates the effect of the APP by comparing the cognitive difficulties of the elder, exploring how to design a more suitable cognitive training APP for Alzheimer's patients, as a new intervention, can provide personalized cognitive training, In future work, this design will be developed and applied to elderly people with mild dementia to enhance their ability to live independently and validate the role of new digital technologies.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
