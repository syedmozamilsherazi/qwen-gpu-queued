Early detection of this disease through regular screening is particularly important in preventing vision loss. To do this, several diagnostic techniques are used ranging from classical techniques centered on an expert to modern diagnostic methods, sometimes completely computerized. The implementation of computerized systems based on the early detection and classification of clinical signs of glaucoma can greatly improve the diagnosis of this disease. Several authors have proposed models allowing the automatic classification of clinical signs of glaucoma. However, not only these models are not efficient enough and remain optimizable but also often do not take into account the problem of data instability in their construction and the performance test measures adapted to evaluate them. In this paper, a predictive model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been introduced to optimize the automated diagnosis of glaucoma signs using patient visual field data. A comparative study of performance as a function of the parameters of this algorithm, which is particularly effective for this type of problem, has been made. The best results for the data collected at the Glaucoma Center of Semmelweis University in Budapest have proven to significantly improve the performance of the models offered so far especially in terms of precision, accuracy and AUC while reducing execution time.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
