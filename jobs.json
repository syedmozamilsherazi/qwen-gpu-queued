Optical coherence tomography (OCT), which provides clear 10-layer cross-sectional images of the retina, is widely used to screen various ophthalmic diseases. A large number of researchers have carried out relevant studies on deep learning technology to realize the semantic segmentation of lesion areas, such as effusion on OCT images, and achieved good results. However, in this field, problems of the low contrast of the lesion area and unevenness of lesion size limit the accuracy of the deep learning semantic segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a boundary multi-scale multi-task OCT segmentation network (BMM-Net) for these two challenges to segment the retinal edema area, subretinal fluid, and pigment epithelial detachment in OCT images. We propose a boundary extraction module, a multi-scale information perception module, and a classification module to capture accurate position and semantic information and collaboratively extract meaningful features. We train and verify on the AI Challenger competition dataset. The average Dice coefficient of the three lesion areas is 3.058\\% higher than the most commonly used model in the field of medical image segmentation and reaches 0.8222.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
