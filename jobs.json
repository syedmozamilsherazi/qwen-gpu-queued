Segmenting retinal layers in OCT images is the first and crucial step in analyzing retinal diseases. In this paper, we describe a method for 3D automatic segmentation of wide-field retinal OCT images based on the Swin-UNTER. This method preprocesses the 15 \\texttimes{} 9mm2 and 6 \\texttimes{} 6mm2 retinal OCT images to maintain relatively similar shape topologies. Subsequently, it fine-tunes using 6 \\texttimes{} 6mm2 retinal OCT images based on self-supervised pre-trained weights, segmenting the 15 \\texttimes{} 9mm2 retinal OCT images into four layers: Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), Ganglion Cell and Inner Plexiform Layer (GCIPL), Inner Nuclear Layer (INL), and Outer Retinal Layer (ORL). Finally, the segmentation results are restored to their original shapes. Our approach reduces the reliance on extensive annotation of 15 \\texttimes{} 9mm2 data during training, enabling effective segmentation of retinal layers in wide-field OCT images. The MIoU value, Dice coefficient, accuracy value can reach 0.91, 0.95 and 0.98 respectively. Additionally, using the segmentation results, we visualize retinal layer thickness variations for a clearer display across the four layers.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
