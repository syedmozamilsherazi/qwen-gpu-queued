Diabetic retinopathy can result in many serious diseases. For various reasons, patients lose a vision because of untimely or incorrect treatment of diabetic retinopathy. The modern method for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is laser coagulation. The ophthalmologist decides which zones need to be shelled to reduce edema based on his experience. Laser radiation parameters and distance between laser shots are also selected based on the experience of previous surgeries. However, the accuracy of the selection of these parameters can affect the result of treatment. Achieving high accuracy empirically is a difficult problem. In this work, the technology for selecting an effective laser coagulation strategy is proposed. It based on a genetic algorithm in which individuals are the tasks of heat equations. Technology solves the problem of choosing accurate laser coagulation parameters.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
