Among the common retinal fundus diseases, glaucoma, cataracts and age-related macular degeneration stand out for their ability to inflict retinal damage, resulting in vision impairment and even blindness. Therefore, early detection of these diseases holds immense importance for subsequent treatment interventions. While numerous studies have explored the classification of fundus image diseases based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the majority have primarily focused on the two types of ophthalmic diseases in the top two prevalences, namely age-related macular degeneration (196 million patients worldwide) and diabetic retinopathy (146 million patients worldwide), with limited attention given to other fundus disease classifications. To address the aforementioned gaps, this research paper aims to employ deep learning technology in conjunction with computer vision techniques to classify and diagnose fundus diseases. The specific research objectives are as follows: (1) Investigation of classical convolutional network models, such as VGGNet19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and Swin-Transformer, training them in three stages. Stage 1 uses network model framework training, stage 2 entails transfer learning training, and stage 3 encompasses training after data enhancement of the dataset. Each stage involves the selection of models exhibiting exceptional performance, ultimately leading to the identification of the optimal model. (2) Leveraging the foundation of convolutional neural networks, a transfer learning-based classification method is proposed for fundus images using a small dataset. This involves utilizing the pre-trained deep learning model screened out in Phase 1, reconfiguring its fully connected layer, and adapting it to the four-classification task of fundus disease. (3) The experimental data is sourced from the Eye Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) database, and the data on the test set should be validated using cross-validation. Additionally, data augmentation is implemented using six techniques facilitated by the OpenCV library. The experimental results show that DenseNet121, based on convolutional neural networks, exhibits superior performance in distinguishing between the four types of fundus diseases, and achieving the optimal classification accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
