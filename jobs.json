Therefore, the use of computer vision model for vascular automatic segmentation has attracted more and more attention. However, there are individual differences in blood vessel morphology, and background noise in fundus images can blur the tiny blood vessels, leading to segmentation difficulties. To solve these problems, we propose a new ML-net method, which improves U-net by integrating frequency-domain information. Wavelet transform and fast Fourier transform are used to decompose the image into different frequency components. Then the high frequency information and low frequency information are processed respectively, so as to realize the filtering and optimization of the original image. In addition, Gabor filters are integrated into the original network to assist the convolutional neural network in feature extraction. Experiments on DRIVE and CHASE_DB1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
