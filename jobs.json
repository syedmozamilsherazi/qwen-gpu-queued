It causes progressive damages in the retina. Due to changes in blood vessels of the retina, several clinical features are observed in the fundus images. Microaneurysms, soft exudates, hard exudates, and haemorrhages are common types of clinical lesions present in fundus images of damaged retina. In this study, an automated diabetic retinopathy detection method was developed to identify such lesions from fundus images. The proposed approach adopted a pixel-based image segmentation model with supervised classifier. Multiple linear and non-linear image filtering algorithms were applied to each fundus image to generate feature dataset, which was used in Random Forest classifier training. The trained classifier model performed the classification-cum-segmentation of each pixel presents in an image. The proposed detection system achieved 98.87\\% accuracy.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
