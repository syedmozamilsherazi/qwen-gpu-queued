Diagnosis of infective keratitis done through clinical findings and slit- lamp examination is intricate and requires high expertise. Most infective keratitis cases are challenging to the clinicians. This paper proposes a deep learning approach enabling a more accurate diagnoses and treatment of infective keratitis. As a first step towards developing a comprehensive deep learning-based disease detection tool, we have classified bacterial and viral keratitis based on slit-lamp images and convolutional neutral network. A total of 446 keratitis images (bacterial \u2013 271 and viral - 175) were available for the study. The experiment was conducted with different CNN configurations: with different input shape (image sizes: 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 400x400) with two and three convolution layers. Image size 64x64 with three convolutional layer and no pooling achieved the highest performance (sensitivity =0.715, specificity= 0.880, precision= 0.807, accuracy= 0.812 and AUC=0.856). Experimental results show that even with a small dataset CNN was able to produce a good classification result.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
