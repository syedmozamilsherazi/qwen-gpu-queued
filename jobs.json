Existing automated systems rely largely on fundus images for assessment of glaucoma due to their fast acquisition and cost-effectiveness. Optical Coherence Tomographic (OCT) images provide vital and unambiguous information about nerve fiber loss and optic cup morphology, which are essential for disease assessment. However, the high cost of OCT is a deterrent for deployment in screening at large scale. In this article, we present a novel CAD solution wherein both OCT and fundus modality images are leveraged to learn a model that can perform a mapping of fundus to OCT feature space. We show how this model can be subsequently used to detect glaucoma given an image from only one modality (fundus). The proposed model has been validated extensively on four public andtwo private datasets. It attained an AUC/Sensitivity value of 0.9429/0.9044 on a diverse set of 568 images, which is superior to the figures obtained by a model that is trained only on fundus features. Cross-validation was also done on nearly 1,600 images drawn from a private (OD-centric) and a public (macula-centric) dataset and the proposed model was found to outperform the state-of-the-art method by 8\\% (public) to 18\\% (private). Thus, we conclude that fundus to OCT feature space mapping is an attractive option for glaucoma detection.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
