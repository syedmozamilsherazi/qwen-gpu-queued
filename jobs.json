Traditionally relying on diagnostic methods like corneal topography, it is essential to explore more accurate and accessible approaches. Thus, in this work, aiming to classify Keratoconus eye disease using transfer learning via anterior segment photographed images (ASPI). ASPI was recorded and extracted into series of images using a smart phone from the lateral view of the eye. The experiment was conducted a thorough analysis to pinpoint the optimal configuration for image classification, addressing efficiency, accuracy, and practicality. Our study demonstrates the significance of optimizer selection and learning rate in transfer learning model development for Keratoconus classification. Specifically, the Adam optimizer, configured with a learning rate of 0.001, showcased outstanding performance with an accuracy of 98.21\\%, precision of 100.00\\%, and recall of 98.24\\%. These results underscore the capacity to improve diagnostic instruments. This paper serves as a valuable resource for the eye imaging and deep learning communities, providing optimal strategies for precise Keratoconus classification and offering insights for the development of more dependable diagnostic tools.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
