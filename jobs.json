WM is the part of human cognition responsible for the short term storing and handling of information; it can, in stressful situations, under information overload or when suffering from dementia-like diseases, become severely limited, possibly leading to poor decision making. Our preliminary results suggest that AUHWM can provide a precise and timely assessment of WM capacity, so that the cognitive load a specific task imposes on users can be adapted, e.g., at the User Interface (UI) level. AUHWM is based on a low-level stochastic discrete model of human WM dynamics, implemented as a Gradient-Boosting-derived deterministic algorithm that simulates users' oblivion. AUHWM also performs Unscented Kalman filtering to track users' WM-specific parameters in real time, thus providing a dynamic assessment of their cognitive resources. Our approach has been tested and validated using data collected from Match$ ^2$s, a visual memory game played by 18 users in another study. Going beyond real-time WM tracking, AUHWM is intended to also be used for WM prediction, paving the way to the adaptation of tasks and their UIs in real time as a function of users' cognitive abilities; we detail an example of such an adapted system, and provide experimental evidence this approach could lead to future enhanced WM-adapted UIs.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
