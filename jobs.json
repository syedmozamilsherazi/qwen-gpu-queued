In the current clinical practice, clinicians screen ubiquitous optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans to visualize the retina's structural changes and diagnose the associated diseases. Quantitative assessment of such structural changes assumes significance in accurate disease management and treatment response monitoring. To this end, various attempts based on image processing, machine learning, and deep learning methods have been reported. However, they have not fully leveraged the unique structural characteristics of retinal sublayers in OCT B-Scans. In this work, we proposed a Pix2Pix-GAN-based algorithm capable of synthesizing look-alike target images from source images by mapping pixel-wise structural information. In particular, we envisioned the Pix2Pix network to synthesize OCT images with each boundary of interest labeled in the same color as the corresponding boundary in ground-truth images. On a dataset of 180 EDI OCT B-Scans with accurate ground-truth segmentation for six retinal sublayer boundaries, we trained and tested the Pix2Pix-GAN model. In particular, we achieved an overall mean Dice coefficient of 96.84 \\% and 96.85 \\%, respectively, for train and test dataset, indicating close agreement between ground-truth and proposed Pix2Pix-GAN-based segmentation.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
