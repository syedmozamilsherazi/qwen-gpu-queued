However, many excellent deep learning models for image classification do not equally achieve good results on DR detection since fundus image classification is different from typical image classification problem. The lesions are usually small and reflected in the part rather than the whole image. In this paper, we investigate the effect of network depth and the relationship between different DR grades. Then we propose a novel attention network to group and classify DR. Our contributions are mainly in three aspects: 1. Find a suitable network depth for DR detection by experiments. 2.Propose a grouping and decoupling mechanism for DR grading. 3. Design a novel deep convolutional neural network to classify DR, which also generates attention map indicating the location of lesions. Experiments show that our network outperforms other methods on the Messidor dataset. We reach the AUC of 96.9\\% and the accuracy of 92.7\\% on binary classification and the accuracy of 81.7\\% on 4-class grading.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
