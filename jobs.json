This paper focuses on the application of a novel detection framework based on the RT-DETR model for analyzing intricate image data, particularly in areas such as diabetic retinopathy detection. Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss globally, requires accurate and efficient image analysis to identify early-stage lesions. The proposed RT-DETR model, built on a Transformer-based architecture, excels at processing high-dimensional and complex visual data with enhanced robustness and accuracy. Comparative evaluations with models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv8, SSD, and DETR demonstrate that RT-DETR achieves superior performance across precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95 metrics, particularly in detecting small-scale objects and densely packed targets. This study underscores the potential of Transformer-based models like RT-DETR for advancing object detection tasks, offering promising applications in medical imaging and beyond.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
