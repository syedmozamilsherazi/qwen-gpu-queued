However, due to its hardware limitations, oral endoscopes often only provide localized imaging, which is not conducive to remote consultations and subsequent intelligent diagnostic assistance. The oral endoscope image stitching algorithm can obtain wide-field oral images through registration and stitching, meeting the needs of daily monitoring and diagnostic assistance. However, the handheld capture method results in significant visual disparities between images, leading to issues such as misalignment, ghosting, and the fragmentation of prominent objects in the stitched images, thereby affecting the diagnosis of related diseases. To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimal suture line search algorithm based on the saliency perception of tooth area regions. By extracting information from tooth area regions and designing relevant constraints, the optimal suture line is guided to pass through color and structurally similar areas while avoiding tooth areas as much as possible. This approach aims to better preserve the original image information and enhance the visual effect of the stitching. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed optimal suture line stitching algorithm based on tooth area saliency perception better retains the detailed information of the original images, effectively improves the visual quality of the stitched images, and is more suitable for assisting in the diagnosis of oral diseases.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
