Improving the accuracy of optic disc segmentation is of great significance to the diagnosis of the above diseases. Based on the PSPNet model, the Phase-Fusion PSPNet network structure is proposed. The network is connected to the phase upsampling module after the pyramid pooling module, which reduces information loss and makes the network suitable for segmentation tasks with fuzzy edges. The principle of phase upsampling module is to upsample the larger size span step by step and combine it with the corresponding size feature map. iChallenge-PM, iChallenge-AMD, and iChallenge-GON as the training and validation datasets in the paper. The IoU and PA of Phase-fusion PSPNet are 89.93\\% and 94.94\\%. Compared with PSPNet, the IoU and PA increased by 1.22\\% and 1.62\\% respectively. Experiments show that adding the phase upsampling module makes the model have a better segmentation performance.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
