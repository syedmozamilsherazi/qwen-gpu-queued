Thin vessels are particularly important as they can indicate early signs of diseases. The challenges with thin vessels are that they have low contrast and can be easily confused with background noise. Variations in vessel width and intensity make uniform detection difficult. Presence of other retinal structures (e.g., optic disc, fovea) can further complicate segmentation. In the context of retinal vessel segmentation, attention can help the model focus more on areas likely to contain thin vessels. To ensure feature diversity, it\u2019s crucial to incorporate both fine-grained details (like edges and textures) and broader, more complex elements (such as intricate objects or structural components). In our paper, we propose a Hierarchical Feature Integrated BoT-UNet with contextual feature enhancement. The proposed architecture preserves U-Net\u2019s core design while innovating its components. Both encoder and decoder sections are substituted with the implementation of bottleneck transformer structures, a modification that substantially decreases computational demands compared to conventional Transformer models. Furthermore, the proposed BoT U-Net incorporates a fusion of convolutional and Transformer elements (hybrid), eliminating the need for pre-trained weights. The architecture employs Hierarchical Feature Integration Block (HFIB) and integrates Contextual Feature Enhancement Block (CFEB) between the encoding and decoding stages to enhance segmentation performance. Additionally, backward fusion mechanisms are employed to aggregate and reintegrate context, enhancing the feature refinement process. This bidirectional fusion ensures effective capture and utilization of both local and global contexts. The proposed network achieves competitive retinal segmentation results on three public benchmark datasets: DRIVE, CHASE DB1, and STARE.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
