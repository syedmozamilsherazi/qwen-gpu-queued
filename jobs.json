The mass screening of populations for DR is time-consuming. Therefore, computerized diagnosis is of great significance in the clinical practice, which providing evidence to assist clinicians in decision making. Specifically, hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard exudates, soft exudates, and other lesions are verified to be closely associated with DR. These lesions, however, are scattered in different positions and sizes in fundus images, the internal relation of which are hard to be reserved in the ultimate features due to a large number of convolution layers that reduce the detail characteristics. In this paper, we present a deep-learning network with a multi-scale self-attention module to aggregate the global context to learned features for DR image retrieval. The multi-scale fusion enhances, in terms of scale, the efficacious latent relation of different positions in features explored by the self-attention. For the experiment, the proposed network is validated on the Kaggle DR dataset, and the result shows that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
