Quantifying retinal vasculature width is significant for evaluating ocular abnormalities, vascular caliber, and systemic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular issues, and nervous system disorders. However, current methodologies face challenges in effectively integrating pixel data for accurate vessel width assessment. This study introduces an optimal quantification approach that incorporates all pixel data without disregarding any connected pixels, utilizing diverse Distance Transform (DT) metrics. Three datasets\u2014Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), High Resolution Fundus (HRF), and LES-AV\u2014each comprising 20, 45, and 22 fundus images, respectively, were employed. We investigated various DT metrics, including Euclidean DT (EDT), Chessboard DT, Cityblock DT, and Quasi-Euclidean DT (QEDT). Following meticulous metric selection, EDT and QEDT demonstrated promising results that met our research requirements, showing significant statistical analyses (p &lt; 0.05 via Two-sample T-test and Tukey post-hoc). Notably, QEDT emerges as the most suitable and statistically significant metric for vessel quantification, meeting the objective to quantify vascular width with the shortest distance possible while incorporating all connected pixels. This finding underscores QEDT's capacity to quantify retinal blood vessels (RBV), highlighting its potential in advancing ophthalmology diagnostics and treatments.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
