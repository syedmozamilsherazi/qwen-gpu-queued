Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular for computer-aided DR diagnosis using retinal fundus images. While these CNNs are highly reliable, their lack of sufficient explainability prevents them from being widely used in medical practice. In this article, we propose a novel explainable deep learning ensemble model where weights from different models are fused into a single model to extract salient features from various retinal lesions found on fundus images. The extracted features are then fed to a custom classifier for the final diagnosis of DR severity level. The model is trained on an APTOS dataset containing retinal fundus images of various DR grades using a cyclical learning rates strategy with an automatic learning rate finder for decaying the learning rate to improve model accuracy. We develop an explainability approach by leveraging gradient-weighted class activation mapping and shapely adaptive explanations to highlight the areas of fundus images that are most indicative of different DR stages. This allows ophthalmologists to view our model's decision in a way that they can understand. Evaluation results using three different datasets (APTOS, MESSIDOR, IDRiD) show the effectiveness of our model, achieving superior classification rates with a high degree of precision (0.970), sensitivity (0.980), and AUC (0.978). We believe that the proposed model, which jointly offers state-of-the-art diagnosis performance and explainability, will address the black-box nature of deep CNN models in robust detection of DR grading.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
