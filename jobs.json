This paper introduces a method for fully automated cell tracking, lineage construction, and quantification. Cell detection is performed in the joint spatio-temporal domain by a motion diffusion-based Partial Differential Equation (PDE) combined with energy minimizing active contours. In the tracking stage, we adopt a variational joint local-global optical flow technique to determine the motion vector field. We utilize the predicted cell motion jointly with spatial cell features to define a maximum likelihood criterion to find inter-frame cell correspondences assuming Markov dependency. We formulate cell tracking and cell event detection as a graph partitioning problem. We propose a solution obtained by minimization of a global cost function defined over the set of all cell tracks. We construct a cell lineage tree that represents the cell tracks and cell events. Finally, we compute morphological, motility, and diffusivity measures and validate cell tracking against manually generated reference standards. The automated tracking method applied to reference segmentation maps produces an average tracking accuracy score (TRA) of 99 percent, and the fully automated segmentation and tracking system produces an average TRA of 89 percent.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
