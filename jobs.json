High blood sugar can be detected with excessive passing of urine, an increase in thirst, and hunger. If it is neglected, a variety of problems may result. Acute effects involve diabetic ketoacidosis and even death. Long-term severe consequences include cardio disease, strokes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute ulcers in the foot, and vision impairment over time. High levels of blood sugar are a hallmark of the metabolic disorder known as (DM)diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are the two primary clinical subtypes. Today, there are much more young persons with type 1 diabetes than ever before. When it manifests in childhood and adolescence, type 1 diabetes is chronic and has a protracted incubation phase. Early signs of the start are not always visible, which makes it more likely that they will go undetected and cause a delay in treatment. Chronic tissue damage and malfunction can be brought on by long-term high blood sugar, particularly in the kidneys, eyes, heart, nerves and blood vessels. The ability to predict diabetes early is crucial. To train on the real data of 520 diabetics, we apply supervised machine-learning techniques in this research like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Ada Boost and Gradient Boosting. The proposed work has accomplished a more exhaustive relative examination between various datasets and their elements that might be done to pinpoint every one of the fundamental qualities for foreseeing diabetes. The best and most exact diabetes forecast calculation might be found by looking at many calculations and calculation mixes.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
