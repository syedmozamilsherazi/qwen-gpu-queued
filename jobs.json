In particular, the use of artificial intelligence techniques has significantly transformed the field of ophthalmology, aiding in the early detection of neurodegenerative eye diseases like glaucoma through image classification. However, the lack of explainability in model decisions poses a substantial barrier to their widespread adoption in clinical practice. This research addresses this limitation by exploring and applying explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for glaucoma classification. Our study focuses on providing ophthalmologists with robust resources for human interpretation and supporting clinical diagnosis. We propose an innovative visual interpretation approach called SCIM (SHAP-CAM Interpretable Mapping) and compare its performance against existing techniques, such as Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Our experiments, conducted on the VGG19 architecture, demonstrate that both Grad-CAM and the novel SCIM approach offer superior resources for human interpretability, further enhancing the potential of CNNs in glaucoma diagnosis.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
