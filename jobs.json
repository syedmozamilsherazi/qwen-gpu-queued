This paper explores the usability and trustworthiness of an AI-driven CDSS designed to assist ophthalmologists in treating diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we created a CDSS and evaluated its impact on efficiency, informedness, and user experience through task-based semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 11 ophthalmologists. The usability of the CDSS was rated highly, with a SUS of 81.75. Additionally, results show that participants felt like the CDSS would improve their efficiency and informedness with one major aspect being integrating Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data into a single interface. Additionally, we explored aspects of the trustworthiness of AI components, specifically OCT segmentation, treatment recommendation, and visual acuity forecasting. Through thematic analysis, we identified key factors influencing trustworthiness and clinical adoption. Results show that a larger degree of abstraction from input to output of a model correlates with decreased trust. From our findings, we propose three guidelines for designing trustworthy CDSS.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
