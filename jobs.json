By noninvasive Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans, a number of abnormal structural changes in the retina, namely retinal lesions, can be identified. Automated lesion localization in OCT is thus important for detecting retinal diseases at their early stage. To conquer the lack of manual annotation for deep supervised learning, this paper presents a first study on utilizing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) for lesion localization in OCT images. To that end, we develop a taxonomy to provide a unified and structured viewpoint of the current SSOD methods, and consequently identify key modules in these methods. To evaluate the influence of these modules in the new task, we build OCT-SS, a new dataset consisting of over 1k expert-labeled OCT B-scan images and over 13k unlabeled B-scans. Extensive experiments on OCT-SS identify Unbiased Teacher (UnT) as the best current SSOD method for lesion localization. Moreover, we improve over this strong baseline, with mAP increased from 49.34 to 50.86.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
