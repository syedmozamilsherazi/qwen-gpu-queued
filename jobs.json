Diabetic retinopathy is an ophthalmological disease that causes bleeding in the fundus and loss of vision due to damage to blood vessels in the retina. It is one of the main causes of vision loss in the world. To slow down the development of the disease, early screening of the eyeball is needed. This paper proposes a new method of classification, automatic screening and accurate diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy based on convolutional neural network. Specifically, five attention mechanisms such as BAM, CBAM, ECA, CA and SeNet are used to classify diabetic retinopathy. Through comparative experiments, it is found that ECA-CBAM cross-combination model has the best classification performance.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
