Our approach begins with blood vessel extraction for locating the optic disk area. Next process, the blood vessel structure was used to estimate the location of the optic disk. Next step, the morphology operator, including erosion and dilation, was used to prepare for attaining the fovea region. Finally, the location of the fovea was estimated by using the position of the optic disk, and specific characteristics of the fovea spot. The proposed method was tested on the DRIVE, DIARETDB0, and DIARETDB1 that is a public diabetic retinal image dataset. The results of the optic disk and fovea localization were compared with the ground truth image. This method can locate optic disk and fovea on DRIVE 100\\%. In DIARETDB0 and DIARETDB1, this algorithm can achieve optic disk 96.15\\% and 98.87\\%, respectively, and locate fovea more than 90\\%.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
