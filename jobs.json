One such manifestation is automatic disease diagnosis, which aims to assist clinicians in conducting symptom investigations and disease diagnoses. When we consult with doctors, we often report and describe our health conditions with visual aids. Moreover, many people are unacquainted with several symptoms and medical terms, such as mouth ulcer and skin growth. Therefore, visual form of symptom reporting is a necessity. Motivated by the efficacy of visual form of symptom reporting, we propose and build a novel end-to-end Multi-modal Disease Diagnosis Virtual Assistant (MDD-VA) using reinforcement learning technique. In conversation, users' responses are heavily influenced by the ongoing dialogue context, and multi-modal responses appear to be of no difference. We also propose and incorporate a Context-aware Symptom Image Identification module that leverages discourse context in addition to the symptom image for identifying symptoms effectively. Furthermore, we first curate a multi-modal conversational medical dialogue corpus in English that is annotated with intent, symptoms, and visual information. The proposed MDD-VA outperforms multiple uni-modal baselines in both automatic and human evaluation, which firmly establishes the critical role of symptom information provided by visuals . The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/DrCanSee\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
