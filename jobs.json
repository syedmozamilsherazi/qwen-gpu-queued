The damage caused by pests and diseases to crops is an important issue in agricultural production. They will have a serious impact on crop growth, yield and quality, and even threaten the sustainable development of agriculture. However, existing detection methods such as visual inspection, image recognition technology, remote sensing technology, etc. all have certain shortcomings. Based on the above content, this article proposes a lightweight method for detecting crop diseases and insect pests based on the Yolov5s model. The model introduces MobileNetV3 to reconstruct the network skeleton, thereby reducing the number of parameters required in the model. In addition, a pyramid architecture model is introduced to improve the high-precision detection of tiny pests. In addition, the ECA mechanism is introduced, which greatly reduces the parameters that need to be entered. This article names the improved detection model ECMB-Yolov5s. The parameters of this model are reduced by more than 80\\%, the detection speed is increased to 15.2FPS, and mAP is also improved by nearly 10\\%.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
