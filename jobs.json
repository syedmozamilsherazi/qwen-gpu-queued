In this study, we propose a multiclass segmentation method for DR images using a codec structure. Specifically, we use an encoder to down-sample the image, followed by feature extraction using a quadruple Multi-scale Receptive Field (MSRF) module to address uneven lesion distribution. We then apply the Bi-layer Feature Fusion (BiLFF) module mechanism to fuse feature maps obtained from down-sampling. This mechanism adaptively learns important foci parts of the features while reducing interference from non-important healthy eye information. Finally, we up-sample the fused features and cascade them with feature maps obtained from corresponding down-sampling. We perform feature extraction on cascaded feature maps to obtain final predicted segmentation maps. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the DDR dataset.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
