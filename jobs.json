Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly reduce the hazards of the disease. However, the lack of effective clinical resources for early diagnosis has been a long-standing problem. In response to this problem, we apply the recent advances in deep neural networks on eye-tracking data in this study to classify children with and without ASD. First, we record the eye movement data of 31 children with ASD and 43 typically developing children on four categories of stimuli to construct an eye-tracking data set for ASD identification. Based on the collected eye movement data, we extract the dynamic saccadic scanpath on each image for all subjects. Then, we utilize the hierarchical features learned from a convolutional neural network and multidimensional visual salient features to encode the scanpaths. Next, we adopt the support vector machine to learn the relationship between encoded pieces of scanpaths and the labels from the two classes via supervised learning. Finally, we derive the scores of each scanpath and make the final judgment for each subject according to the scores on all scanpaths. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model has a maximum classification accuracy of 94.28\\% in the diagnostic tests. Based on existing research and calculation models, dynamic saccadic scanpaths can provide promising findings and implications for ASD early detection. Furthermore, integrating more information of the scanpaths into the model and developing a more in-depth description of scanpaths can improve the recognition accuracy. We hope our work can contribute to the development of multimodal approaches in the early detection and diagnosis of ASD.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
