Diagnosis of DR requires an experienced ophthalmologist and it is a tedious and time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based automated diagnosis system that can classify various stages of DR accurately. A hierarchical approach is adopted for classification in which we break down our classification task into two stages. In the first stage we perform binary classification obtaining the true positive and negative samples and in the second stage, five class classification is performed on those images classified as true positive, false positive and false negative in the first stage of classification. Our approach of classifying hierarchically takes care of the class imbalance in the data by removing the most dominant class 0 (No-DR) from the dataset at the binary classification stage. The proposed method uses the Inception-v3 CNN for feature extraction in which we use the features from second last layer of both main and auxiliary classifiers. The extracted features are concatenated into a single feature vector to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for both binary and multiclass classifications. Experiments are conducted on \"Kaggle\" dataset and our approach attains an accuracy of 87.7\\% on validation data for binary classification and 81.8\\% for multiclass classification. Our results are better than the recently proposed approach using CNN indicating that the hierarchical classification performs better for multiclass classification.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
