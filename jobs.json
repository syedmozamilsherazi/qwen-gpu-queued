In its early stages, DR often presents no symptoms, but if it is not treated, it can lead to blindness. Early diagnosis is critical to preventing this progression. This study introduces a method for detecting DR in retinal fundus images by combining Gabor filters with the ConvNeXt deep learning model. Gabor filters help to capture microvascular changes in the retina, which are critical for identifying DR. ConvNeXt, a modern convolutional architecture, is used to enhance the accuracy of medical image classification. We utilized the APTOS 2019 dataset, which contains 3,662 retinal fundus images, each labelled to reflect one of five DR severity levels. One of the challenges posed by this dataset is the class imbalance, which was addressed using oversampling techniques to improve the model's performance. We applied data augmentation techniques such as contrast adjustment, flipping, rotation, and translation to further enhance the dataset's diversity. Our results show that the ConvNeXt model without Gabor filters achieved an accuracy of 77.45\\% in testing. When Gabor filters were incorporated, the accuracy improved to 86.74\\%. These findings demonstrate that using Gabor filters in conjunction with ConvNeXt significantly improves the detection of DR, highlighting the potential of this approach as a tool for automated DR severity assessment.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
