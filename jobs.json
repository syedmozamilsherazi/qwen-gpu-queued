However, successful usage of endogenous electroencephalogram(EEG)-based BCI applications is often not trivial, due to EEG variations between and within sessions and long user training required. In this work we suggest an approach to deal with this two main limitations of EEG-BCIs by inserting a progressive and expandable neurofeedback training program, able to continuously tailor the classifier to the specific user, into a multimodal BCI paradigm. We propose indeed the integration of EEG with a non-brain signal: the pupillary accommodative response (PAR). The PAR is a change in pupil size associated with gaze shifts from far to close targets; it is not governed by the somatic nervous system and is thus potentially preserved after the evolution from LIS to CLIS, which often occurs in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Multimodal BCIs have been broadly investigated in literature, due to their ability to yield better overall control performances, but this would be the first attempt combining EEG and PAR. In the context of the BciPar4Sla, we are exploiting these two signals, with the aim of developing a more reliable BCI, adaptive to the extent of evolving together with the user\u2019s ability to elicit the brain phenomena needed for optimal control, and providing support even in the transition from LIS to CLIS.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
