Deep learning techniques play an important role in the automatic grading of DR. However, the significant morphological differences and diverse types of lesions in DR images often lead to the neglect of the dependencies between lesions, which can significantly affect the final grading results. Additionally, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often lose contextual and discriminative information during feature extraction. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Multi-Scale Contextual Cross-Attention Network (MCCNet) for DR classification. The network includes residual blocks, a Global Context Module (GCM), a Context Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), and a Multi-Scale Feature Module (MSFM). First, the residual blocks and GCM extract lesion features while considering the global contextual information of the lesions. Then, the CAFM fuses global and multi-scale contextual information through a cross-attention mechanism to reduce information loss during the convolution process. Finally, the MSFM learns the dependencies between different lesions through dilated convolutions. DR grading is performed through a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 88.93\\% and 96.04\\% on the APTOS-2019 and Messidor-2 datasets, respectively, outperforming other methods.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
