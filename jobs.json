According to the existing deep learning model, the identification rate of similar lesion points in DR is low, resulting in low classification accuracy. This paper first designs a new attention mechanism called Global Channel Attention (GCA) mechanism, and then combines the GCA attention mechanism with the classical deep learning model EfficientNetB0, and proposes the convolutional neural network model GCA-EfficientNet (G-ENet) used for DR grade classification. This paper adopts a transfer learning strategy to train the Kaggle-DR dataset. Finally, the accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score of the G-ENet model on the verification set reached 96.0\\%, 96.1\\%, 95.9\\%, 99.0\\%, and 96.0\\%, respectively. The classification performance was significantly better than that of classical models such as ResNet-50, GoogLeNet, DenseNet-121 and VGG16. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has good results in the classification task of diabetic retinopathy grade, which can provide help for early screening and diagnosis of diabetes.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
