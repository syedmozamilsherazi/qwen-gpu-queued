The extensive use of digital healthcare produces a massive amount of multimedia healthcare data continuously (e.g., MRI, X-Ray, ultrasound images, etc.). Hence, it needs special data analytics techniques to provide a smart diagnosis to the patients. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, particularly Deep learning (DL) methods, have demonstrated tremendous medical diagnosis progress and achievements. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), cataract, macular degeneration, and glaucoma are the most common eye problems due to diabetes. Numerous models have been proposed using deep learning models to diagnose diabetic retinopathy, but no model is perfect for detecting DR diseases. This article presents a deep learning model to analyze diabetic retinopathy images to classify DR patients\u2019 severity levels. The model applies a custom-weighted loss function in the model\u2019s training and achieves 92.49\\% accuracy and a 0.945 Cohen Kappa score on test data. The model\u2019s weighted average precision was 93\\%, recall 92\\%, and f1 score 93\\%. The model is compared with several state-of-the-art pre-trained models. We observe that the proposed model performs better in accuracy results and Cohen Kappa score.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
