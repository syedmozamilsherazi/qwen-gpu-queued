Ophthalmology is an area of medicine that deals with the eye and vision. In many remote areas, people do not have access to ophthalmologists, and many go blind for preventable reasons. Awareness about eye health and early diagnosis is essential in eye health to prevent blindness. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can quickly detect eye disease is valuable and necessary. Anterior segment eye images are essential and easily obtained without additional equipment. In this study, I aimed to build an artificial intelligence algorithm to detect eye diseases from mobile photographs. I extracted and combined anterior segment eye photos from various publicly available datasets and labeled 3938 images as Normal (healthy) and 1094 images as Abnormal (unhealthy). I increased the data diversity by augmenting it with random flips and rotations: and then prepared it for AI training. I re-trained the algorithms trained in ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge with the transfer learning method. I compared custom and pre-trained models. After evaluating the performance of the models with the test set, 98\\% accuracy and 97\\% F1 score were obtained with the Inception-ResNetV2 model.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
