Although traditional camera-based techniques are promising, multiple issues hinder their wide adoption including the privacy concern, strict lighting condition and line-of-sight (LoS) requirements. On the other hand, wireless sensing without a need for dedicated sensors gains a tremendous amount of attention in recent years. Among the wireless signals utilized for sensing, acoustic signals show a unique potential for fine-grained sensing owing to their low propagation speed in the air. Another trend favoring acoustic sensing is the wide availability of speakers and microphones in commodity devices. Promising progress has been achieved in fine-grained human motion sensing such as breathing using acoustic signals. However, it is still very challenging to employ acoustic signals for eye blink detection due to the unique characteristics of eye blink (i.e., subtle, sparse and aperiodic) and severe interference (i.e., from the human target himself and surrounding objects). We find that even the very subtle involuntary head movement induced by breathing can severely interfere with eye blink detection. In this work, for the first time, we propose a system called BlinkListener to sense the subtle eye blink motion using acoustic signals in a contact-free manner. We first quantitatively model the relationship between signal variation and the subtle movements caused by eye blink and interference. Then, we propose a novel method that exploits the \"harmful\" interference to maximize the subtle signal variation induced by eye blinks. We implement BlinkListener on both a research-purpose platform (Bela) and a commodity smartphone (iPhone 5c). Experiment results show that BlinkListener can achieve robust performance with a median detection accuracy of 95\\%. Our system can achieve high accuracies when the smartphone is held in hand, the target wears glasses/sunglasses and in the presence of strong interference with people moving around.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
