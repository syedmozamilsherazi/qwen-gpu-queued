Traditional methods can diagnose fundus diseases and their severity, but there are few studies on the characteristics of fundus diseases, which cannot give a reasonable explanation for the diagnosis of fundus diseases. Therefore, a convolutional neural network based on dual attention mechanism was proposed to realize automatic diagnosis of multiple fundus lesions with high accuracy. Convolutional neural network uses a residual structure with jumping connections, and channels and spatial attention mechanisms are embedded after each group of convolution to improve the accuracy of fundus lesions diagnosis. The model was tested on the clinical data of Ningbo Eye Hospital Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical University. The diagnostic accuracy of GON, retinal exudates and retinal hemorrhage were 98.17\\%, 97.49\\% and 97.15\\%, respectively. The experimental results showed that: the model showed good feature extraction ability and diagnostic performance in multi-lesion diagnosis of fundus, which provided reference value for subsequent medical artificial intelligence diagnosis research.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
