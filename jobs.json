Traditional detection methods such as vascular ultrasound and angiography are quite accurate. However, they need costly equipment and specialized staff. This limits their use in home health monitoring. This study aims to come up with a non-invasive and low-cost way to detect carotid artery atherosclerosis. It makes use of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology. Through non-contact optical methods, it collects cardiovascular-related physiological parameters. Then it calculates carotid pulse wave velocity (PWV) as an indication of arterial stiffness. The study analyzes grayscale video data and sample points from dual laser light sources. MATLAB is used for signal processing and PWV calculation. The initial results indicate that the PWV measured by rPPG has a good correlation with traditional methods. This confirms its effectiveness. There are challenges. One is to extract the subtle variations in skin luminance. How to measure the time and distance that the pulse wave travels is also an important issue to discuss in this study. Approaches like grayscale transformation, zero-phase filtering, and cross-correlation analysis, along with interpolation algorithms can possibly be solutions to the measurements. The use of rPPG to examine the carotid regions that are susceptible to noise is what makes this study novel. Cross-correlation functions are also employed to deal with precise image data. This technology may prove to be valuable for evaluating risks and preventing atherosclerosis at an early stage, which can contribute to treating cardiovascular diseases.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
