Even though there are benefits of early treatment, unfortunately, over 40\\% of individuals with PD over 65 years old do not see a neurologist. It is often very difficult for these individuals to get to a physician's office for diagnosis and subsequent monitoring. To address this problem, we present PARK, Parkinson's Analysis with Remote Kinetic-tasks. PARK instructs and guides users through six motor tasks and one audio task selected from the standardized MDS-UPDRS rating scale and records their performance via webcam. An initial experiment was conducted with 127 participants with PD and 127 age-matched controls, in which a total of 1,778 video recordings were collected. 90.6\\% of the PD participants agreed that PARK was easy to use, and 93.7\\% mentioned that they would use the system in the future. We explored objective differences between those with and without PD. A novel motion feature based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of optical flow in a region of interest was designed to quantify these differences in the collected video recordings. Additionally, we found that facial action unit AU4 (brow lowerer) was expressed significantly more often, while AU12 (lip corner puller) was expressed less often in various tasks for participants with PD.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
