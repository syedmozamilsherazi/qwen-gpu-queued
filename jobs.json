Existing automated systems rely largely on fundus images for assessment of glaucoma due to their fast acquisition and cost-effectiveness. Optical Coherence Tomographic (OCT) images provide vital and unambiguous information about nerve fiber loss and optic cup morphology, which are essential for disease assessment. However, the high cost of OCT is a deterrent for deployment in screening at large scale. In this article, we present a novel CAD solution wherein both OCT and fundus modality images are leveraged to learn a model that can perform a mapping of fundus to OCT feature space. We show how this model can be subsequently used to detect glaucoma given an image from only one modality (fundus). The proposed model has been validated extensively on four public andtwo private datasets. It attained an AUC/Sensitivity value of 0.9429/0.9044 on a diverse set of 568 images, which is superior to the figures obtained by a model that is trained only on fundus features. Cross-validation was also done on nearly 1,600 images drawn from a private (OD-centric) and a public (macula-centric) dataset and the proposed model was found to outperform the state-of-the-art method by 8\\% (public) to 18\\% (private). Thus, we conclude that fundus to OCT feature space mapping is an attractive option for glaucoma detection.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
