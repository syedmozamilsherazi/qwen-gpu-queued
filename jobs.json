As the cardinal manifestation, hypomimia, referred to as impairments in normal facial expressions, stays covert. Even some experienced doctors may miss these subtle changes, especially in a mild stage of this disease. The existing methods for hypomimia recognition are mainly dominated by statistical variable-based methods with the help of traditional machine learning algorithms. Despite the success of recognizing hypomimia, they show a limited accuracy and lack the capability of performing semantic analysis. Therefore, developing a computer-aided diagnostic method for semantically recognizing hypomimia is appealing. In this article, we propose a Semantic Feature based Hypomimia Recognition network, named SFHR-NET, to recognize hypomimia based on facial videos. First, a Semantic Feature Classifier (SF-C) is proposed to adaptively adjust feature maps salient to hypomimia, which leads the encoder and classifier to focus more on areas of hypomimia-interest. In SF-C, the progressive confidence strategy (PCS) ensures more reliable semantic features. Then, a two-stream framework is introduced to fuse the spatial data stream and temporal optical stream, which allows the encoder to semantically and progressively characterize the rigid process of hypomimia. Finally, to improve the interpretability of the model, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to generate attention maps that cast our engineered features into hypomimia-interest regions. These highlighted regions provide visual explanations for decisions of our network. Experimental results based on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting hypomimia.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
