Early detection of this disease through regular screening is particularly important in preventing vision loss. To do this, several diagnostic techniques are used ranging from classical techniques centered on an expert to modern diagnostic methods, sometimes completely computerized. The implementation of computerized systems based on the early detection and classification of clinical signs of glaucoma can greatly improve the diagnosis of this disease. Several authors have proposed models allowing the automatic classification of clinical signs of glaucoma. However, not only these models are not efficient enough and remain optimizable but also often do not take into account the problem of data instability in their construction and the performance test measures adapted to evaluate them. In this paper, a predictive model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been introduced to optimize the automated diagnosis of glaucoma signs using patient visual field data. A comparative study of performance as a function of the parameters of this algorithm, which is particularly effective for this type of problem, has been made. The best results for the data collected at the Glaucoma Center of Semmelweis University in Budapest have proven to significantly improve the performance of the models offered so far especially in terms of precision, accuracy and AUC while reducing execution time.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
