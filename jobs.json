Despite significant progress in recent years, there are still several important issues remain unsolved. First, abnormal fluid lesions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) show large variations in location, size, and shape. Second, fluid lesions are contiguous regions with smooth surfaces and without holes inside. In this study, we introduce an adapted fully convolutional neural network (FCN) architecture to improve the ability of the network to extract multi-scale fluid lesions in OCT. Then we introduced a novel curvature loss term to regularize the shape prior in the loss function. The proposed method was extensively evaluated on RETOUCH dataset with a mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.767 and mean absolute volume difference (AVD) of 0.036 mm3, which improved significantly compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
