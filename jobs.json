It is often used to observe medical volumes such as CTs and MRIs, but the rendering results may not present multiple regions of interest (ROIs) well. In order to solve this problem, a method of fusing ROIs based on transfer functions is proposed in this paper. The entire process is divided into three steps. Firstly, two pairs of one-dimensional color transfer function (1D-CTF) and one-dimensional opacity transfer function (1D-OTF) are designed to separate different target structures. Secondly, a fusion method is taken to combine the 1D-CTFs and 1D-OTFs to get a new pair of transfer functions. Finally, the original volume is rendered again with the new transfer functions to get the fusion image of ROIs. Experiments show that the resulting images not only integrate the ROIs appearing in the two different cases, but also present their spatial relationships clearly. Besides, both visual perception and information entropy evaluation confirm that this kind of fusion is better than image-level fusion and accumulation-level fusion. On the whole, this method facilitates the analysis of medical volumes and the diagnosis of diseases.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
