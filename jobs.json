Thin vessels are particularly important as they can indicate early signs of diseases. The challenges with thin vessels are that they have low contrast and can be easily confused with background noise. Variations in vessel width and intensity make uniform detection difficult. Presence of other retinal structures (e.g., optic disc, fovea) can further complicate segmentation. In the context of retinal vessel segmentation, attention can help the model focus more on areas likely to contain thin vessels. To ensure feature diversity, it\u2019s crucial to incorporate both fine-grained details (like edges and textures) and broader, more complex elements (such as intricate objects or structural components). In our paper, we propose a Hierarchical Feature Integrated BoT-UNet with contextual feature enhancement. The proposed architecture preserves U-Net\u2019s core design while innovating its components. Both encoder and decoder sections are substituted with the implementation of bottleneck transformer structures, a modification that substantially decreases computational demands compared to conventional Transformer models. Furthermore, the proposed BoT U-Net incorporates a fusion of convolutional and Transformer elements (hybrid), eliminating the need for pre-trained weights. The architecture employs Hierarchical Feature Integration Block (HFIB) and integrates Contextual Feature Enhancement Block (CFEB) between the encoding and decoding stages to enhance segmentation performance. Additionally, backward fusion mechanisms are employed to aggregate and reintegrate context, enhancing the feature refinement process. This bidirectional fusion ensures effective capture and utilization of both local and global contexts. The proposed network achieves competitive retinal segmentation results on three public benchmark datasets: DRIVE, CHASE DB1, and STARE.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES - BE VERY INCLUSIVE:\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract mentions ANY eye disease (diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, retinal, macular, etc.)\n- Abstract mentions ANY AI/ML technique (neural network, deep learning, segmentation, classification, detection, CNN, etc.)\n- Abstract describes automated/computerized analysis of eye images\n- Abstract mentions fundus images, OCT scans, retinal images, or ophthalmic imaging\n- Abstract describes segmentation, feature extraction, or pixel-based analysis for eye disease\n- Abstract discusses diagnosis, detection, classification, grading, or prediction of eye conditions\n- Abstract mentions dataset of eye/retinal/fundus images\n- Abstract is about computer-aided diagnosis for ophthalmology\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but the title suggests relevance\n- Abstract is MISSING (select by default)\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY confirms ALL of these:\n- This is ONLY a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not original research) AND\n- NO AI/ML/DL methodology is actually used or proposed AND\n- The focus is NOT on eye diseases at all\n\n================================================================================\nCRITICAL EXAMPLES:\n- \"Pixel-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Segmentation IS an AI/image processing technique!)\n- \"Automated identification using feature extraction\" = Abstract_Selected\n  (Automated + feature extraction = computational/AI approach!)\n- \"Deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation\" = Abstract_Selected\n- \"CNN-based classification of fundus images\" = Abstract_Selected\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT (one word only):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
