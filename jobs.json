Sometimes, these features can also be the indicators for the examination of hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes. However, retinal blood vessels are often very small and complex in distribution, which brings toughness to the doctors when doing the operations of the segmentation of retinal blood vessels. Although the deep learning manners represented by U-Net has performed very well in the field of the segmentation of the images of the retinal blood vessel in recent years, the above-mentioned inconvenience still cannot be effectively settled. For the purpose of improving the correct rate of the segmentation and settling the above-mentioned inconvenience we propose a network called SF-U-Net, which uses accurate shape estimation and feature restoration to achieve the improvement of the accuracy. We follow the structure of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and Skip Connection of U-Net and use deformable convolution to accurately capture the shape of blood vessels when extracting features at the coding layer to overcome the problem of complex blood vessel distribution. At the decoding layer, we adopt a novel dual-stream up-sampling method to achieve accurate feature restoration. Experimental results show that our SF-U-Net is capable of improving the segmentation results of retinal blood vessels conspicuously. In the experiment, we use both fundus image datasets called DRIVE and CHASE-DB1 and the experimental results of multiple indicators on them surpass other deep-learning methods significantly. The experimental results of the SF-U-Net model on a variety of indicators on DRIVE dataset exceed the experimental performances of the currently most advanced methods. The mean accuracy is 0.9602 the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.9848 and the sensitivity is 0.8567.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nIF ANY of the following is TRUE:\n- Abstract confirms AI/ML/DL method for eye disease\n- Abstract describes automated diagnosis/detection for ophthalmology\n- Abstract mentions dataset of retinal/fundus/OCT images with ML analysis\n- Abstract is UNCLEAR but suggests AI application in eye care\n- Abstract describes deep learning model for any eye condition\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Deleted\nONLY IF the abstract CLEARLY confirms:\n- This is a review/survey/meta-analysis paper (not primary research)\n- No AI/ML/DL methodology is used at all\n- The disease is NOT eye-related\n- The paper is editorial/commentary/opinion only\n\n================================================================================\nIMPORTANT: When abstract is missing or unclear, SELECT (Abstract_Selected).\nWe prefer false positives over missing relevant papers.\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Respond with EXACTLY one label only (no explanation):\nAbstract_Selected\nOR\nAbstract_Deleted\n\nYOUR RESPONSE:",
