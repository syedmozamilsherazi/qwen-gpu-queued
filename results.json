Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss. We propose a novel deep learning approach for automated detection of RVO using retinal fundus images. Our method uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) as a feature extractor and fine-tunes it with a custom-designed loss function for RVO detection. The model is trained on a large dataset of retinal fundus images and achieves high accuracy in detecting RVO. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for automated detection of RVO.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected",

Early detection and timely intervention can significantly improve outcomes. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for early detection of DR using fundus images. We employ a pre-trained ResNet50 model fine-tuned on a large dataset of DR images. The model achieves an accuracy of 93.6% in detecting DR stages ranging from mild to severe. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set, achieving an accuracy of 92.4%. The proposed method shows promising potential for clinical implementation, reducing the burden of manual interpretation and improving patient outcomes. \n\n================================================================================\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected\nYour response exactly matches the criteria provided for \"Abstract_Selected\".
