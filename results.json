Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss. We propose a novel deep learning approach for automated detection of RVO using retinal fundus images. Our method uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) as a feature extractor and fine-tunes it with a custom-designed loss function for RVO detection. The model is trained on a large dataset of retinal fundus images and achieves high accuracy in detecting RVO. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for automated detection of RVO.\n\n================================================================================\nSELECTION RULES (BE INCLUSIVE - DO NOT MISS RELEVANT PAPERS):\n================================================================================\n\nOUTPUT: Abstract_Selected",
